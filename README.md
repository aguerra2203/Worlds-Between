# Worlds-Between
A top-down, dimension-hopping roguelike


After getting lost in the multiverse, path your way through countless worlds to find your way home

Combine items and abilities from all dimensions to create your perfect playstyle

This prototype is representative of my gameplay loop which describes how the player will switch between different dimensions and how this idea becomes the core of the game.  This prototype answered my question of whether or not having levels completely separate from each other would still make the game fun and interesting. This idea works great within the game, though I can only really be sure when the levels are filled with the other elements of the game, such as varying enemies and weapons. I don't think I would change anything about how this mechanic functions right now, but the next place I would take this prototype is adding weapons and power-ups to each dimension so they can feel fully separate from each other.
